## Machine Learning
There are many ML books, but most of them are encyclopedic. <br/>
I recommend to take a course using Murphy or Bishop book.

## Deep Learning
Goodfellow et al. is the new classic. <br/>
For vision and NLP, Stanford lectures would be helpful.

### Textbook

### Tutorial
- [ICML 2017 Sequence-To-Sequence Modeling with Neural Networks](https://sites.google.com/view/seq2seq-icml17)


## Generative Model
I seperated generative model as an independent topic, <br/>
since I think it is big and important area.

### Lecture

- [Toronto CSC2547 Learning Discrete Latent Structure](https://duvenaud.github.io/learn-discrete/)
- [Toronto CSC2541 Scalable and Flexible Models of Uncertainty](https://csc2541-f17.github.io/)


## Reinforcement Learning
For classic (non-deep) RL, Sutton & Barto is the classic. <br/>
For deep RL, lectures from Berkeley/CMU looks good.

### Textbook
- Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction (Sutton & Barto) :sparkles:

### Lecture
- [UCL Reinforcement Learning](http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/d.silver/web/Teaching.html) :sparkles:

### Tutorial
- [ICML 2017 Deep Reinforcement Learning, Decision Making, and Control](https://sites.google.com/view/icml17deeprl)


## Graphical Model
Koller & Friedman is comprehensive, but too encyclopedic. <br/>
I recommend to take an introductory course using Koller & Friedman book. <br/>

Wainwright & Jordan only focuses on variational inference, <br/>
but it gives really good intuition for probabilistic models.

### Textbook
- Probabilistic Graphical Models: Principles and Techniques (Koller & Friedman)
- Graphical Models, Exponential Families, and Variational Inference (Wainwright & Jordan) :sparkles:

### Lecture
- [Stanford CS228 Probabilistic Graphical Models](http://cs.stanford.edu/~ermon/cs228/index.html)
- [CMU 10708 Probabilistic Graphical Models](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~epxing/Class/10708/) :sparkles:


## Optimization
Boyd & Vandenberghe is the classic, but I think it's too boring. <br/>
Reading chapter 2-5 would be enough.

Bertsekas more concentrates on convex analysis. <br/>
Nocedal & Wright more concentrates on optimization.

### Textbook
- Convex Optimization (Boyd & Vandenberghe) :sparkles:
- Convex Optimization Theory (Bertsekas)
- Numerical Optimization (Nocedal & Wright)

### Lecture

### Tutorial
- [ICML 2017 Recent Advances in Stochastic Convex and Non-Convex Optimization](http://people.csail.mit.edu/zeyuan/topics/icml-2017)


## Learning Theory

For learning theory, Kearns & Vazirani is the classic; but it's too old-fashined. <br/>
Abu-Mostafa is a good introductory book, and I think it's enough for most people.

For online learning, Cesa-Bianchi & Lugosi is the classic. <br/>
For multi-armed bandit, Bubeck & Cesa-Bianchi provides a good survey.

- Foundations of Machine Learning (Mohri et al.)
- An Introduction to Computational Learning Theory (Kearns & Vazirani)
